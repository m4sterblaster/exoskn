#Overview

EXOSKN _Pronounced as exo-skin_. EXplorer's Onion SKiN, an exo-skin for space explorers. 
An open sourced space suit - project by Citizen Inventor, inspired by NASA Space App Challenge 2014.

Rationale and story behind the project, as well as forward looking roadmap, answers to my favourite questiions: who, what, why, when, how can all be found at the official website [http://exoskn.weebly.com]()

## What
A spacesuit augmented by embedded electronics to extra vehicular activities (EVA) 

## How
Using arduino + sensors, any other COTS wearable and creative thinking to augment the space suit experience for easier movement, better health and safety. The concept emphasis on modularity and ease of use. A very natural interface is expected to be brought by the sensor network layer - a wearable undergarment - amongst the many layers of garment considered.
